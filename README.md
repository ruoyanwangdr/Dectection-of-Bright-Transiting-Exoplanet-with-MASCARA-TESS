# Detection of Bright Transiting Exoplanets with MASCARA/TESS

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to detect new transiting exoplanets by combining data from the ground-based
MASCARA with those from the NASA TESS mission, as the two telescopes share the same magnitude
range in observations. Although at order of magnitudes higher photometric precision, TESS monitors
stars for only 27 days, which could possibly omit the long-term variability and fail to detect long-period
planets. With years of MASCARA data involved, nonetheless, potential candidates lacking the number
of observed transits necessary for confirmation in the TESS data could be verified by cross reference.
We aim to find exoplanets through light curves in MASCARA database, with assistance from TESS in
various planetary parameters for both visual and program inspection. In case of insufficient candidates,
we also intend to characterize the performance of MASCARA as a transit survey by injecting signals
into the light curves and testing the signal recovery rate.
